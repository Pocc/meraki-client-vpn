# Contributor Code of Conduct
*TLDR: Follow the golden rule.*

## Rules
1. Github is a place for professionals to write code

2. If a contributor does not behave like a professional, they risk having their 
contributions removed

3. The latest version of the code of conduct at http://contributor-covenant.org 
shall be used if this is not clear enough
