# How to contribute to MerLink

## Contributing Code
### Pull Requests

Please verify the following before submitting:
* Pull requests should resolve existing issues. If an issue does not exist for 
your pull request, create one and document the problem. 
* Put 'closes #\<issue num>' in your commit/PR to [auto-close the issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) 
that your PR fixes.
* Code has comments where comments are needed
* Test your code before submitting

### Adding Documentation

Add markdown files to the **docs** folder and create an issue/pull request as
 above. Ideally, this project comes with all of the documentation that it 
 requires.

### Programming Resources

* [Python 3.5](https://docs.python.org/3.5/)
* [Qt 5.10](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.10/)
* [PyQt](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/introduction.html)
* [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
* [Mechanical Soup](https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup)

Qt's documentation of libraries is more extensive than PyQt's. If there is a 
library you have questions about, Qt's documentation will be superior, and the 
C++ code *mostly* translates.

## Issues and Feature Requests
### I found a bug!
* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under 
[Issues](https://github.com/pocc/merlink/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, 
[open a new one](https://github.com/pocc/merlink/issues/new), and tag as a bug. 

### Feature requests
When desired functionality is not present, make a feature request. Add your 
suggestion to 
[Feature Requests](https://github.com/pocc/merlink/projects/4) kanban board 
so it can be categorized and prioritized. At some point this process may move
 to Trello if we need a better way to monitor which feature requests are most 
wanted.
